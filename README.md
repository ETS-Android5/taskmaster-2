## Feature Tasks

- The homepage has a heading at the top of the page, an image to mock the “my tasks” view, and buttons at the bottom of the page to allow going to the “add tasks” and “all tasks” page.

### Add a Task

- On the “Add a Task” page, allow users to type in details about a new task, specifically a title and a body. When users click the “submit” button, show a “submitted!” label on the page.

# Lab 27: Data in TaskMaster

## Overview

-Today, you'll add the ability to send data among different activities in your application using SharedPreferences and Intents.

### Feature Tasks

#### Task Detail Page

- Create a Task Detail page.
- It should have a title at the top of the page, and a Lorem Ipsum description.

#### HomePage

- The main page should be modified to contain three different buttons with hardcoded task titles.
- When a user taps one of the titles, it should go to the Task Detail page, and the title at the top of the page should match the task title that was tapped on the previous page.
